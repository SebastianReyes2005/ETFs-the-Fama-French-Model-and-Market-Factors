# ETFs-the-Fama-French-Model-and-Market-Factors
This is a brief project I undertook for a data analysis course I took at Yale. It uses data analysis tools in R to provide a comprehensive explanation of the five-factor Fama-French economic model and a few other major market factors by comparing the performances of five major ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM, IWD, IWF) and explaining how the observed differences can be tied to Fama-French factors. The main summary document is **"ETFs, the Fama-French Model, and Market Factors.pdf".**
